	  		<p class="homeTxt"> Json libraries are used when interchanging between objects and text formats. In a typical scenario, data exchanges between server and browser can only be with text, since Json is in text format, an object can be converted and then sent to the server/browser, Json is then received and turned into objects. The main objective is to be able to use objects as data without complicated parsing.</p>
