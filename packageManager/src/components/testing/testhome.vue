	  		<p class="homeTxt"> Is an automated (or manually) implementation of short code fragments that tests entire interfaces, classes, or other components during the development process. Unit tests are written and run by software developers or white box testers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended. The goal of unit testing is to show that individual parts of a whole program are correct, consequently, this helps with finding problems early during the development process and easier documentation. </p>
